# Cryptocurrencies

This analysis was to assist a client at Accountability Accounting firm, an investment banck, on their offering of a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to their customers. My job in this is to create a report that inclused all of the cryptocurrencies that are trading in the market, and how they could be grouped together to create a classification system for this new investment. 

Unsupervised learning is being used in this task, and to group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm is being used. Data visualization will be used to share our findings with the board.

The following deliverables will be provided:
- Pre-processing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrency Results
